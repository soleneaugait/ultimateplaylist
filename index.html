            <h1>Solène's ultimate playlist</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my ultimate playlist! Here, you will find some of my favourite artists, songs and albums of all time. Music is what i love most in this world, I cannot go a day without listening to some music. It has a huge impact on my mood and emotions and I cannot really live without it. It has become kind of a safe place for me, or maybe it has always been. My parents used to listen to a lot of music when I was younger, I grew up with music playing in the background at all times and listening to so many genres. Just to give you an idea, in 2023, I played music for more than 50,000 minutes, or 833 hours, which represent 10% of my year. I think this shows how much i love music and also how it is a constant thing in my life. You can click on the picture to go and have a look at my Apple Music profile to see all 80+ of my playlists and see what I play on a daily basis. Enjoy! -Solène;)</p>

            <h1>The 1975</h1>
            <p>The 1975 have become my favourite band. I discovered them in the beginning of 2023 and loved their music instantly. I started by listening their first self-titled album "The 1975". This album turned 10 years old in 2023, the year I discovered it. And it is still so accurate, it has not gotten old one bit! This album is the album I have listened to most in my entire life. The first year, I played it 545 times (which is actually insane). I just love their music so much, it speaks to my soul.</p>

            <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
            <p>Taylor Swift is the most inspiring artist to me. She is an incredible performer which is one of the things I admire the most about her. As long as her resilience: she has taken a lot of punches throughout her life but she always fought back and never gave up to show up. I chose her album Reputation to represent her in this list as it is the album that made me fall in love with her completely after watching the Reputation Stadium Tour movie on Netflix. It is not necessarily my favourite album, I don't have one, I could never choose.</p>

            <h1>Rx by Role Model</h1>
            <p>Rx by Role Model is my most listened to album in 2022. I played it 346 times in the space of 6 months (which, again, is insane). I just love the vibes on this album and it has one of my favourite songs ever on it.</p>

            <h1>"Once There Were Dragons" by John Powell</h1>
            <p>This song is from the soundtrack of one of my favourite animated movies: "How To Train Your Dragon 3". It is the last song in the movie, it is almost 6 minutes long and it makes me cry almost every single time I play it. It is one of the most beautiful piece of classical music I have ever heard, it is so powerful and hits me to my core.</p>

            <h1>Heartbreak Weather by Niall Horan</h1>
            <p>Heartbreak Weather by Niall Horan is very dear to me. This album got me through the first lockdown in 2020. I have very vivid memories of me listening to it when I was stuck in my house for days on end. The song title "Heartbreak Weather" is one of my favourite songs ever. It is so cathartic and so cheerful, I always puts me in a good mood.</p>

            <h1>"come over x" by modernlove.</h1>
            <p>This song is one of my favourite songs of all time. modernlove. is a very unknown British band I discovered on Instagram. This song is the first of theirs that I have ever heard and I fell completely in love with it. I actually almost got a tattoo of the heart on the album cover but the tattoo artist couldn't make it happen in the end. But that is how much I love this song.</p>

            <h1>LANY</h1>
            <p>LANY is my second favourite band. LANY stands for Los Angeles New York. They are a very American band, if that makes sense. It is like their music was written for me. It is everything that I love in terms of lyrics, instruments, everything. I chose to represent them with their 3rd album "mama's boy" as it is the first album from them I fully listened to when it came out in 2020. Before that, I had only ever heard one of their singles "Good Girls" in 2017 but never really looked into them. Until 2020, when they just came back into my life very randomly with their song "if this is the last time" that is on "mama's boy". And I have been obsessed with them ever since.</p>

            <h1>Ariana Grande</h1>
            <p>Ariana Grande was my favourite singer when I was a teenager. She is the artist that made me love the way I do today. I actually got the chance to go to one of her shows for the Dangerous Woman World Tour in 2017, just after the terrorist attack at her show in Manchester. She was my greatest inspiration for a long time, I would listen to her music absolutely everyday without fail. Although I don't love her and her music as much as I used to, it is hard to deny she is an incredible musician, singer and performer, one of the best of our time. I chose to represent her with her album "thank u, next" as I think it is my favourite.</p>

            <h1>Harry Styles</h1>
            <p>Harry Styles is one of the greatest artist of this generation. He is very complete. He is an actor, an amazing song-writer, musician and performer. I love the entirety of his work but I chose to represent him with his second album "Fine Line" as I think it is my favourite album of his. They are all really really good but "Fine Line" has one of my favourite songs which is the song title "Fine Line", the last track on the album. It is such a beautiful and powerful song.</p>

            <h1>The Lion King soundtrack by Hans Zimmer</h1>
            <p>The Lion King is one of my favourite movies. And that is in part due to the incredible soundtrack on the movie. The soundtrack is composed by Hans Zimmer who we all know. He is a very talented musician, he made soundtracks for Interstellar, Inception, Dune, Pirates of the Caribbean and many many more. The Lion King is my favourite work from him. The songs in the movie just make me happy and cheerful, as much as they can make me cry. I love it so so much, it is such a powerful soundtrack.</p>

            <h1>The Babylon soundtrack by Justin Hurwitz</h1>
            <p>Babylon is my favourite movie of all time. And it is just over a year old, it came out late 2022. When I saw this movie with my father at the theatre, I was completely overwhelmed, I was crying and shaking. This movie is just so brilliant and beautiful in every single way. The director, Damien Chazelle, is a talented movie director. So far, he's directed Whiplash, Lalaland and First Man which are all absolute masterpieces in my opinion. He works with the composer Justin Hurwitz who makes amazing soundtracks, and all of them are mind-blowing. And the Babylon soundtrack makes no exception, the album is my second most played album last year, this soundtrack is a masterpiece.</p>

            <h1>Shawn Mendes</h1>
            <p>Shawn Mendes was my second favourite artist when I was a teenager. He got me through the struggles that one can go through when being a teen. His music still touches me very deeply. It makes me very nostalgic. He is a great song-writer and performer as well. I will always happily listen to his music and I will always support his art.</p>
